RDF-Trine-AllegroGraph
======================

This package provides a compatibility layer between the generic RDF::Trine framework and
AllegroGraph, the store (and server) provided by Franz Inc.

With it you can use 'AllegroGraph' as additional backend store:

    Pro: - using RDF::Trine's SPARQL 1.1 implementation and AG's
           SPARQL 1.0 queries

         - have a SPARQL protocol end point (not that of AG!) exposed

    Con: probably VERY slow at any serious data set (will be
         addressed in future versions)

NOTE: This has only been tested with a AGv4 server, not AGv3.

NOTE: This package will need a fair bit of work to perform nicely. As a prerequisite, RDF::Trine
will have to allow for standard functionality to be replaced.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

To enable the test with a living AGv4 backend, do a

  export AG4_SERVER=http://myuser:mypass@localhost:10035
